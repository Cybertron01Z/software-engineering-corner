## How to add a blog post
To add new blog posts without having to ask for being added to the Zuhlke organisation, the easiest way is forking this repository with your github user and write your blogpost in your fork of this repository. If you need help with how forking works, please refer to this guide by github: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo.

After that you can start working on your blogpost in your repository. For information about the metadata in your blogpost and specific markdown of Hashnode please refer to their template repository: https://github.com/Hashnode/Hashnode-source-from-github-template

When you are ready you can then open a pull request to this repository and set somebody from the organisation as the reviewer. As soon as this person has reviewed your PR and everything has been resolved, it can be merged onto the main branch. If you're unfamiliar with this, please refer to this guide by github: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow

## Upload and use pictures
To use pictures you can upload them with the Hashnode [uploader tool](https://hashnode.com/uploader). This will output a url which you can include in your blog post.
