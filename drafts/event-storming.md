# DDD: How to do Event Storming?

At Z√ºhlke, there is a **DDD Topic Team** to discuss about various topics related to Domain-Driven-Design. Recently, we had a session about **Event Storming**. In this post, I would like to share how we did it and some key takeaways.

## What is Event Storming?

Event Storming is a workshop-based method to collect all possible events that can happen in the system. This workshop takes place as one of the early meeting where software developers and domain experts bring in as much ideas/events as possible from their domain knowledge. This facilitates the participants to learn from each other and get the big picture of the problem domain.

The result of the meeting is sticky notes spread around in a feasible timeline. This artifact can then be used as a means for requirement engineering.

## The Procedure

To practise during the DDD Topic Team meeting, we decided to do event storming for the time period between the marriage proposalüíç and the wedding üë∞ü§µ. It was not a real work example for desigining a software system, however it was good to understand the method outside software development.

**1. Collect domain events individually (~10min)**

As first, we started to brainstorm individually for about 10 minutes and collected possible domain events. An event is written in the passive form (e.g. *Invitations are sent*) and denoted in an orange sticky as shown below.

The collected events can be chaotic on the board. But that's okay. The important benefit of this step is that it gives everyone the chance to think off and collect events from their perspective.

**2. Pick some pivotal events (~5min)**

**3. Arrange events in a timeline (~30min)**

**4. Storytelling (~2min)**

## Result

The example above is not a real-life scenario of the software system.
