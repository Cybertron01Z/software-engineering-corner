# DDD: How to do Event Storming?

At ZÃ¼hlke, there is a **DDD Topic Team** to discuss about various topics related to Domain-Driven-Design. Recently, we had a session about **Event Storming**. In this post, I would like to share how we did it and some key takeaways.

## What is Event Storming?

Event Storming is a workshop-based method to collect all possible events that can happen in the system. This workshop takes place as one of the early meeting where software developers and domain experts bring in as much ideas/events as possible from their domain knowledge. This facilitates the participants to learn from each other and get the big picture of the problem domain.

The result of the meeting is sticky notes spread around in a feasible timeline. This artifact can then be used as a means for requirement engineering.

## The Procedure

**1. Collect events individually (~10min)**

**2. Pick some pivotal events (~5min)**

**3. Arrange events in a timeline (~30min)**

**4. Storytelling (~2min)**

## Result
