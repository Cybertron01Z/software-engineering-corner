It was no surprise when Angular announced last August [on their official blog](https://blog.angular.io/the-state-of-end-to-end-testing-with-angular-d175f751cb9c) that they've decided to deprecate Protractor.
Version 12 of Angular already added support for other e2e testing frameworks.
At one of our customers, we therefore migrated the existing Protractor tests to Cypress.
We used this as a chance to improve the tests themselves.

## The Problem

<!--
    - repeating actions going through ui 
    - slow, brittle, many requests
    - due to structure of application and general testing strategy
-->

## App Actions

<!--
    - link to Cypress best practices about app actions
    - explanation of purpose and functionality
-->

## Angular

<!--
    - how to setup in Angular
    - different ways
    - "backendService" example
-->

## Abstraction through Commands

<!--
    - add Command and Utils function
    - reasoning
-->
